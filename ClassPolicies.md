# Grades

This course is a prototype and therefore is not as elaborate as most
CSSE courses.  The primary way you are intended to learn is:

* Listening to professors' experiences
* Trying out a few things on your own

| Attendance | Homework |
|------------|----------|
| 50%        | 50%      |

As a result, attendance is for the most part mandatory.  I will allow
two absences per term without penalty, but after that I will
penalizing your grade

The homework is going to be mostly open ended and freeform - asking
you to try out techniques and simply provide evidence.  What we will
be evaluating is simply if you have made an attempt.  It should be
less than an hour per week.

# Late Policy

All homeworks are due at 11:55PM on the TUESDAY before class.

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This
course has no 'late day' policy and late assignments are generally
worth 0 points unless you have made special arrangements.

However occasionally unforseen situations can arise. I handle all
situations on a case-by-case basis. Here are some general guidelines:

-   Because of the easy nature of the class, my expectation is that
    you will generally be able to get it done, barring catastrophic
    problems.  I will not be happy if you make work for me by being
    frequently late.
-   I keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be
    overusing the privilege we will stop allowing extensions.
-   The usual extension I will provide is 24 hours. Occasionally I may
    allow 48 hours. More than that is very unlikely.
-   If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble
    completing the assignment (e.g. a bug you can't fix or just
    difficulty understanding) get help from me! Don't assume that more
    time will fix the problem; plan to get help.



# Academic Honesty

All assignments in this course are individual. Feel free to discuss
the general idea of the assignments with your classmates, or use them
as resources when you get stuck. BUT do not give or receive code from
other students.

Cheating on even a single assignment is grounds for failure in the
course, plus a letter in your file.

Because attendance is such an important part of the class, lying about
attendance issues is a serious issue and will be penalized as such.
