# Agent Mode Assignment



In the Spring, I wrote an assignment in CSSE 376 Software Quality Assurance for a feature called Edit Mode. The **very day** that I published this assignment to students, Agent Mode became a widely available thing. So, what I would ask that you do, is:



1. Try to generally follow the same instructions in the original document in this folder, LLM Lab.docx. The code is provided here as well.
2. Wherever it says to use **Edit Mode** or **Copilot Edits**, instead use **Agent Mode**. (you may need to enable this setting in your IDE)
3. Use the freely available GPT5-mini.



## Get the trial version of the Cursor IDE

While you can do this in VS Code per the original instructions, to get the full experience of doing development with an AI Agent, I want you to instead get a trial of an IDE called Cursor. Cursor is just a reskin of VS Code, but the developers added some static prompting and optical illusions to make it appear to go faster than VS Code.



Again, if you have VS Code, you can also enable Agent Mode in that, but VS Code's Agent Mode feels much slower than Cursor's equivalent. Both IDEs use the same underlying LLMs and any differences you see in the lists are just a question of how much money you are paying for them.
