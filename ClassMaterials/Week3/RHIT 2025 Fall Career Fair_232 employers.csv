While failures can be inconvenient in commercial microelectronics, they can be devastating in life-critical or mission-critical systems. Rel-Micro engineers have developed tools that allow failures to be discovered, and mitigation techniques developed, before the first part is built or deployed. Once vulnerabilities of a technology are known, Rel-Micro engineers also support critical semiconductor infrastructure needs through system-level, circuit-level, and technology-level design solutions. 

Reliable MicroSystems LLC is a small business registered in the State of Tennessee and located in Franklin. It employs engineers who are internationally known in the military and aerospace microelectronics field, and their design expertise covers every major semiconductor technology node and all the major integrated circuit design environments.
