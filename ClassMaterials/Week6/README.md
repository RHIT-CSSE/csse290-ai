# Programmatic Calls to AI Assignment

## Instructions

1. Write the code. 
    
    a. You are given the stub for a simple interactive command-line app that asks the user for the date, the location, and their gender. The app will also use the date and location to ask a weather API for some info about the weather. 
    
    b. You will put the weather report and gender and anything else you deem necessary into a prompt that asks for weather-specific clothing suggestions.
    
    c. Make the call to the OpenAI API. 
    
    d. Parse the response and display the results.
    e. If you have trouble with parsing, it's ok - limit yourself to 1 hour of coding. 

2. Write a short reflection at the top of your code file. Include anything interesting you learned while developing this. Like,
    
    a. Did it get it right the first time or not? Explain. 
    
    b. If you made the call with the same input twice, did the AI give the same clothing suggestions? 

    c. Describe another app of interest **to you** that would benefit from a call to an LLM.  

3. Capture a screenshot showing one run of the program. 

4. Submit your screenshot and your code with reflection.


## Notes and hints:

You will need an API key to call Open AI's models. The key is in moodle in a file near the dropbox. You'll need to put the key in a .env file with the line:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-pr...obQA

The actual key will be much longer.

The .gitignore file is set up not to commit your .env with the key.
